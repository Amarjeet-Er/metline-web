                        Till the early eighties, kitchenware in the average Indian home would constitute primarily
                        copper, aluminum and stainless steel utensils; cutleries in the form of tea-cups, saucers and
                        spoons; cookware of aluminum; plastic bottles to store spices, sugar, salt and edible oil. The
                        only sophisticated cookware was perhaps the pressure-cooker. Gradual changes were seen with
                        stainless steel utensils replacing copper and aluminum.

                        According to the research report, the kitchenware products market will grow at a considerable
                        CAGR rate to reach over INR 55 billion by 2020 due to the increasing number of nuclear families
                        and exposure of online distribution channels.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-2">
                        Future growth of Kitchenware Products Market is expected to be driven by emergence of web
                        aggregators and rise in preferences towards branded kitchenware products.

                        In terms of the retail formats, the exclusive distributorship is on the decline and the sales
                        through large general merchandisers are increasing because of the western mall shopping culture
                        in the urban areas. There is a need for more specialized stores dealing in the kitchenware
                        products. These can be in the form of large format ‘category-killers or an up-market small size
                        store which deals in specific types of kitchenware products.
